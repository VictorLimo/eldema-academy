            Eldema Letap Academy is a community based educational institution
            started in the year 2005, it supports children of ages between 3 to
            13 years mostly from humble backgrounds to achieve universal basic
            education at an affordable rate, for the past twenty years of its
            operation more than 10,000 children have benefited from the program
            and many more are looking for the opportunity but resources
            constrain them. Eldema letap Academy mostly depends on
            well-wishersand donors to run its daily activities. The school
            operates in Dagoretti Sub County, Nairobi County, Kenya and mostly
            serves the children from the areas of Mutu-ini, Waithaka,
            Kawangware, Riruta and Ngando. Currently the school has over 350
            pupils.
